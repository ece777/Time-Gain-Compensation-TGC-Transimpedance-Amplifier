# Time-Gain-Compensation-TGC-Transimpedance-Amplifier

Brief pre and post layout simulation results of the design of time gain compensation (TGC) transimpedance amplifier.
More simulation results and topology reviews will be included after my thesis defense at the university.
The project is realized using 0.18 Âµm Silicon on Insulator (SOI) process technology from X-FAB. 
The simulation is done using Spectre in the Cadence Virtuoso with BSIM4v4.70 as the transistor model
